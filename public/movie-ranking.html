  Favorite anime and has incredible fighting and action scenes. Also has great
  pacing as a majority of the movie is fighting.

  Great plot, has great fight scenes and the prequel is necessary to appreciate
  Season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen. Also Yuta's story is finally revealed after being
  referenced in Season 1.

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>

  Loved how it completes Avenger: Infinity War. Also had an incredible war that
  was like nothing I've seen before. Thanos is my favorite villain in the Marvel
  universe.
